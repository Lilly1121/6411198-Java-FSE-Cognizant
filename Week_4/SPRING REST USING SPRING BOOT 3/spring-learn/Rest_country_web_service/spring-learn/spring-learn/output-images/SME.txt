 1. What happens in the controller method?
  getCountryIndia() method:

Loads Spring context from XML file

Retrieves bean country (of type Country)

Returns the bean object

Logs start and end of method using SLF4J

2.How is the bean converted to JSON?
Spring Boot automatically uses Jackson (dependency from spring-boot-starter-web) to:

Convert any POJO (Country) returned by a @RestController method

Serialize it into JSON format

No need to write explicit serialization logic
